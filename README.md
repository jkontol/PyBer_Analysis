# PyBer Ride-Share Analysis

##Project Overview

In this case study we will examine the data from Pyber, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. We will look at the time frame of January 2019 to early May 2019 to give the CEO a look at how the business is performing across different cities and city types. 

##Analysis

With this data we can see a view of the number of drivers by city types. As expected there are a larger concentration of drivers in the more urban areas. This is clearly shown by the larger circle sizes.

The number of rides by city type is another interesting view. Again the more densely populated urban areas show a larger number of rides given.

In the next 3 graphs we look at the percentage of drivers, rides, and fares for each city type. In all three the urban areas account for the majority of the graphs. This data could be broken down even further to show which cities have the highest impacts on these numbers. This would let Pyber know where they may need to target more advertising to due to performance issues.

The last and most important view shows how Pyber came to be worth $2.3 bililon. The lines on this graph represent the fares that are coming in from the various city types. The urban areas are hugely successful, but we cannot discount the large amount of profits coming in from the suburban areas. By utilizing this type of graph Pyber can see how their business is impacted over time, and that is a very powerful viewpoint.
